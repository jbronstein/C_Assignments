Homework 2

1) I just tested to see if there was an overlap or not through an if statement, if there wasn't then I copied the array over. Should run fine.

2) Good to go, use the extrema function to find mean and adjust the array values so I can properly calculate the standard deviation

3) Text file self explanatory

4) This heap gave me quite a few headaches. I tried to continually do everything within my heapify function and I couldn't solve it. So I went to that trusty internet for some advice and found a wikipedia article regarding heapsort. I followed their idea of breaking up the heapify into a couple functions and that helped break this problem down into smaller subproblems. It made a lot more sense after that.

5) This is assuredly not the most efficient way to alphabetize. I didn't know if we should malloc as we go or just malloc everything up front. I chose the latter. I also bubblesort the pointers, it was just the simplest way to sort. 

6) I think this was straightforward enough, used the dmatrix function to malloc the proper amount of memory for the matrix then outputted the result.

7) I think I'm outputting this correctly… I'm not entirely sure though, I understand what we were supposed to do and spoke with John about this on the Thursday session, I'm just not sure if I did the 1D array as expected.

8) I didn't complete this one, I got frustrated after awhile and gave up. I realize it should just be an extension of 7, but for some reason I'm just not getting the result.

9) Pretty self explanatory. Use the abs_sort function to sort the array and used the compare function to properly sort the absolute values.

10) These functions were all slight variations of the same idea I found, nothing too difficult and I think I did them all as intended.
